Pros and Cons

Here are some quick advantages and disadvantages of using CoffeeScript. This isn't comprehensive by any means but I think this is sufficient to get a quick overview of the system.

Yays
Python style whitespacing
Ruby styled lightweight syntax
Concise function declarations
JSLint approved
Class based inheritance
There are, of course, numerous other points including semantic and syntactic enhancements.

Nays
Slight learning curve involved
Deployment, depending on your route, may be a chore
You'll need a basic knowledge of JS for debugging purposes. You can't directly start here, naturally.
