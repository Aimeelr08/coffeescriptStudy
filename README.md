# Install 
Get the node.js utility and use npm install coffee-script [or for the source, bin/cake install] to install and get started.

# Pros and Cons

Here are some quick advantages and disadvantages of using CoffeeScript. This isn't comprehensive by any means but I think this is sufficient to get a quick overview of the system.

#Yays
Python style whitespacing
Ruby styled lightweight syntax
Concise function declarations
JSLint approved
Class based inheritance
There are, of course, numerous other points including semantic and syntactic enhancements.

#Nays
Slight learning curve involved
Deployment, depending on your route, may be a chore
You'll need a basic knowledge of JS for debugging purposes. You can't directly start here, naturally.
